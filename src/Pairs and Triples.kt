//making pairs

/*
We can create a pair by creating an expression connecting two values,such as two strings,
with the keyword to, then using .first or .second to refer to each value.
*/

/*You create a triple using Triple() with 3 values. Use .first, .second
 and .third to refer to each value.
*/

The above examples use same type as a part but the parts could be a string, a number,
or a list, for exampleâ€”even another pair or triple.
 */
